# Trademark & Identity Notice (Personal Profile Instance)

This repository is my personal GitHub profile implementation (an "instance"), not a reusable template.

## Not granted (identity / trademark)
No permission is granted to reuse in a way that suggests affiliation, endorsement, or impersonation:
- Names/identity: "VictorAOPS", "Victor David Dector Ramirez", "AlgorithmOps" (and confusingly similar variants).
- Logos, banners, brand marks, or signature visuals associated with VictorAOPS / AlgorithmOps.
- Any representation likely to cause confusion about authorship.

## Where to reuse properly
If you want a reusable template, use the official template repository:
https://github.com/VictorAOPS/VictorAOPS-profile-template

Thanks for reaching out — happy to collaborate.

To qualify this quickly and propose the right path, please share:

1. **Objective:** What exact outcome are you targeting?
2. **Context:** What process/team/use case is this for?
3. **Target KPI:** Which metric should improve (and baseline if available)?
4. **Constraints/Data:** Timeline, compliance constraints, and data sources currently available.

Once I have this, I can propose a concrete next step.

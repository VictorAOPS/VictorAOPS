# Saved Reply 02 — NDA-Friendly Response

Thanks — we can absolutely work in an NDA-friendly mode.

How I usually handle this:
- In public: high-level architecture, delivery approach, expected outcomes.
- In private/NDA: implementation details, sensitive data structures, and internal constraints.

If needed, share your NDA process and I will align to it before we go deeper.

A practical way to move this forward is:

1. **Discover**
   - Process baseline, constraints, KPI targets
   - Deliverable: scope + quick-win map

2. **Model**
   - Data/KPI definitions and governance-ready structure
   - Deliverable: single-source logic and metric definitions

3. **Deploy**
   - Dashboards/apps/automations for decision signals
   - Deliverable: first production-ready workflow

4. **Adopt**
   - Cadence, ownership, and evidence trail
   - Deliverable: sustained operating routine

If this works for you, I can propose a focused first sprint based on your current context.
